# 📌 Student Placement Prediction

🚀 **Deployed Project:** Your Student Placement Prediction system is now live! This project predicts whether a student is "Placed" or "Not Placed" based on their academic and skill-based parameters.

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
This machine learning model determines whether a student will be placed based on the following criteria:

- **CGPA** 📊
- **10th Grade Marks** 🎓
- **12th Grade Marks** 🎓
- **IQ Level** 🧠
- **Communication Skills** 🗣️

The model classifies students into two categories:
✅ **Placed**  
❌ **Not Placed**

---

## 🔥 **Key Features**
- **Fast Predictions** ⚡
- **User-Friendly Deployment** 🌐
- **Data-Driven Insights** 📈
- **Scalable and Efficient** 🚀

---

## 🏗️ **How It Works**
1. Input student data (CGPA, grades, IQ, communication skills).
2. The trained model processes the input.
3. The system outputs either **"Placed"** ✅ or **"Not Placed"** ❌.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**
- **Python** 🐍 (for model development)
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.)** 🤖
- **Flask / FastAPI** 🌍 (for backend deployment)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** 🎨 (for frontend UI)
- **Cloud Deployment (AWS, Heroku, etc.)** ☁️

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**
1. Open the deployed web app.
2. Enter the required student details.
3. Click on "Predict" and get instant results.
